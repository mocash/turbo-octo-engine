            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our collaborative space at the Yale School of Art! This website is a dynamic project shaped by the
                collective efforts of individuals spanning various disciplines within our community.</p>

            <p>As a wiki, every graduate student, staff member, and faculty member has the ability to contribute and modify
                the content. Soon, logins will be available for our friends, alumni, and other members of the school to
                join in the collaboration.</p>

            <p>Click "Edit this page" to log in with your Yale ID, allowing you to make changes or additions visible to
                everyone.</p>

            <p>While not every part of every page is open for editing by everyone, we value diverse voices and perspectives.
                Although there are some locked areas, the majority of the site encourages free and open interaction.</p>

            <p>Our collaborative community ensures that this website is a reliable source of information, reflecting the
                multifaceted aspects of life within our institution. You may encounter content that surprises you or with
                which you don't agree, showcasing the richness of our community.</p>

            <p>If you have questions or concerns about the website, please email <a

            <h2>More about this site</h2>
            <p>This site's graphic templates and inner workings were crafted by Tamara Maletic and Dan Michaelson of the
                graphic design partnership Linked by Air, along with Takashi Okamoto of MudCorp. Dan, a faculty member, was
                instrumental in its development.</p>

            <p>Our site stands out as a module-based wiki. Authors choose modules suitable for their content, such as a
                calendar, image gallery, list, official course description, or general text. Each module intelligently
                organizes and formats content in a vibrant and systematic manner. Authors combine multiple modules to
                create complete and engaging pages.</p>
