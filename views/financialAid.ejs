            <h2>Financial Aid</h2>
            <p>
                Financial aid—defined as a combination of work study, education loans, and scholarships—is designed to assist
                students in financing their educations. Our goal is to ensure that any admitted student can afford to attend
                the Yale School of Art, regardless of his or her financial resources. Approximately 79% of our population
                receives scholarships. The average scholarship award for those who were eligible was $29,685.
                In conformity with University policy, financial assistance is determined only after a student has been
                accepted for admission and is awarded solely on the basis of financial need and available resources within the
                Yale School of Art. There are no scholarships based on merit or any criteria other than financial need. The
                School determines financial need in accordance with formulas established by institutional and federal
                methodologies.
                Students are encouraged to plan their finances for each year with the utmost care so that they are prepared to
                cover their anticipated need at the start of the program. Our financial aid awards for 2015-16 are based on a
                cost of attendance that includes tuition, allowances for living expenses, books & supplies, and healthcare
                coverage. The School cannot guarantee additional help once the financial aid award is determined.
                The process of applying for financial aid differs slightly, depending on whether you are a newly admitted
                student, returning student, or a student seeking just student loans. The financial aid application deadline for
                new students is March 1. You are encouraged to apply well before the admissions decision date to ensure the
                best possible funding. The application deadline for returning students is March 15.
                Individuals in default of a federal student loan will not be granted a financial aid award until clearance of
                such is provided to the School. In addition, financial aid in any form is authorized contingent upon the
                student’s maintaining satisfactory academic progress.

            <p>
                Eligible students are strongly encouraged to seek specific information about Veterans Administration (VA)
                benefits from their local VA Office by calling (888) 442-4551 or by visiting their website. For information
                regarding Yale’s participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program or for an application form.

            <h2>Work Study and Part-Time Employment</h2>
            <p>
                Work study as part of your financial aid award indicates eligibility for a job within Yale. There are a number
                of jobs within the School of Art (admissions, labs, studio crews, etc.) that pay $13.50 per hour in 2015-16. If
                you are awarded a job within the School, you will be notified by the supervisor. Generally, it will involve
                four-to-six hours a week during the regular academic year only. Art positions may be limited, and not all MFA
                students necessarily will be assigned a job within the School. So it is suggested you examine the Yale Student
                Employment Office (246 Church Street) online student job search. This job search engine lists campus,
                community service (Federal Work Study), and other categories of employment for which you can apply online.

        <!-- Teaching Assistantships Section -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Teaching Assistantships</h2>
            <p>
                Appointments to assistantships are made by the dean and faculty of the School of Art and are usually awarded
                only to second-year students. A student may not apply for an assistantship because all appointments are based
                on individual merit and performance qualifications and not on financial need. Teaching assistantships may be
                for one or two terms, and the gross monthly payments (which generally range between $500 and $700) are based
                on the number of class hours and sections. Yale offers a searchable database of grants currently available. If
                you are a new American and under 31 years of age, you might consider applying for the Paul & Daisy Soros
                Fellowships for New Americans. Please note that any outside grants, fellowships, or scholarships are considered
                financial resources and would reduce any awarded Yale scholarship dollar-for-dollar.
